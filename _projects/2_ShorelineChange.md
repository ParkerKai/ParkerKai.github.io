We use a variety of platforms to observ coastal change. This incluedes GPS surveys using backpacks, ATVs, Jetskis, boats, etc. We also increasingly use arial photography and structure from motion or satellite imagery for shoreline detection.

We use these data to monitor the beach and see how beach volumes change over time as a function of waves, season, and large scale ocean patterns (e.g. El Nino, PDO, etc.)

These data are then often used for modelling. I support work as part of CoSMoS coast which uses data assimilated shoreline models to predict future shorelines. This work here uses longshore transport equations to look at how wave forcing effects beaches around stabalized inlets. This work helps for sediment management, especially nearshore placement of dredge spoils as a win-win solution for coastal erosion.
