Hi, I’m Kai Parker, a coastal/data scientist with a passion for blending new technology and ocean science. I’ve spent over a decade working on coastal hazard modeling, data science, climate resilience, and nature-based solutions, mostly along the U.S. West Coast. Right now, I’m a Physical Scientist at the U.S. Geological Survey, where I lead technical work on coastal hazard projects like CoSMoS in the Salish Sea. My research interests include everything that touches the coast and the people who live there.  

My work blends science, technology, and community engagement. I build tools, models, and workflows that turn massive datasets into useful, easy-to-understand information for decision-makers and local communities. Whether it’s using machine learning to study shoreline change in Chile or creating regional hazard assessments for the U.S. Southeast coast, I’m always looking for ways to make science more accessible and impactful. I strongly believe that science is and should be collaborative and work closely with partners ranging from tribal governments to other federal agencies and academia. I’ve published in journals like Nature Climate Change and Scientific Reports, and I love working with interdisciplinary teams that bring together engineering, ecology, and policy.

I’m also big on mentorship, collaboration, and getting out in the field. I’ve supported early-career scientists, led stakeholder workshops, and contributed to adaptation planning in both high-tech and low-resource settings. I hold certifications for SCUBA, motorboat operation, wilderness safety, and more—because sometimes the best science happens outside the lab. At the end of the day, I’m driven by a simple goal: helping coastal communities thrive in the face of change.
